## FAQ

### What is "d8s"?

"d8s" is an [abbreviation (a.k.a. a10n)](https://github.com/democritus-project/d8s-strings/blob/7bf42182960a852ec6dfa58a51831a4fe8a0d552/democritus_strings/strings.py#L30) for "democritus". There are three components to an `a10n` abbreviation. The first character is the first character of the word (in this case, "d" for "democritus"). The last character is the last character of the word (in this case, "s" for the last letter in "democritus"). The number in the middle is the number of characters between the first and last letter (in this case, 8). Thus, "d8s" is an abbreviation for "democritus".

```
democritus
|--------|
d   8    s
```

[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) uses this as "Kubernetes" also goes by "k8s".

### What versioning scheme does the Democritus project use (and why)?

We use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). You can read more about our reasoning behind this [here](https://github.com/democritus-project/roadmap/issues/46).
